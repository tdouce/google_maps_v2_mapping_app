Google maps v2 mapping application.  JQuery parses a json file to populate the google map.  The html "communicates" with the map so that when you interact with a feature in the html the cooresponding google maps marker responds, and vice versa. To give some context, this is an html page from a website where a user would be searching for water-quality measuring stations across the southeast by geographic location and a few other parameters, such as Oxygen, Nitrogen, etc. This page is what could/would be the results from a user's query. It allows the user to explore the results of the query. The pagination buttons and link aren't working since this is just a mockup, and for that matter the content isn't correct. (i.e. data is not correct either).
